# cheesyProgram

This basic console application was created to exercise the use of format manipulators in C++.
The amount of asterisks displayed is adaptive, and the values will always align with one another.

This program takes in the user input for the amount of kg of 'cheese' produced, then reckons the amount of containers needed to hold it, the cost of production, then the profits netted from making the sales.

The backbone of this assignment was the use of setw(), setfill(), and setprecision().
